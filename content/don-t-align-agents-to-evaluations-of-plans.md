> [!info]
> This post is another stab at explaining [_Don't design agents which exploit adversarial inputs_](/dont-design-agents-which-exploit-adversarial-inputs).

After asking several readers for their understandings, I think that I didn't successfully communicate my points to many readers. I'm now trying again, because I think these points are deeply important. In particular, I think that my arguments rule out many target AI motivational structures, including [approval-directed agents](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/7Hr8t6xwuuxBTqADK/approval-directed-agents-1) (over a rich action space), [approval-based amplification](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fRsjBseRuvRhMPPE5/an-overview-of-11-proposals-for-building-safe-advanced-ai#4__Approval_based_amplification___relaxed_adversarial_training) (if the trained agent is supposed to be terminally motivated by the amplified overseer's ratings), and [some kinds](https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/indirect-normativity-write-up/) of indirect normativity.

Albert Einstein doesn't have to be alive in reality for that.

# Grader-optimization doesn't seem sensible

Subtitle: Don't try directing a superintelligence to maximize your valuations of their plans using a consequentialist procedure

I'm going to try saying things and hope to make something land. While I'll mostly discuss grader-optimization, I'll sometimes discuss related issues with argmax’ing over all plans.

<hr/>

An agent which desperately and monomaniacally wants to optimize the mathematical (plan / state / trajectory) $\mapsto$ (evaluation) "grader" function is _not_ aligned to the goals we had in mind when specifying / training the grader (e.g. "make diamonds"), the agent is aligned to _the evaluations of the grader_ (e.g. "a smart person's best guess as to how many diamonds a plan leads to").

Don't align an agent to _evaluations which are only nominally about diamonds_, and then expect the agent to care about diamonds! You wouldn't align an agent to care about cows and then be surprised that it didn't care about diamonds. Why be surprised here?

Grader-optimization fails because _it is not the kind of thing that has any right to work_. If you want an actor to optimize $X$ but align it with evaluations of $X$, you shouldn't be surprised if you can't get $X$ out of that. In that situation, the actor doesn't give a _damn_ about diamonds,[^1] it cares about evaluations.

<hr/>

[Rounding grader-optimization off to "Goodhart"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jFCK9JRLwkoJX4aJA/don-t-design-agents-which-exploit-adversarial-inputs?commentId=tqGBFJ3Kfs7pynJCc) might be _descriptively accurate_, but it also seems to miss useful detail and structure by applying labels too quickly. More concretely, "grade plans based on expected diamonds" and "diamonds" are _not even close to each other._ The former is not a close proxy for the latter, it's not that you're doing something which almost works but not quite, it's just not a sensible thing to even _try_ to align an AI on.

We can also turn to thought experiments:

1. Consider two people who are fanatical about diamonds. One prefers pink diamonds, and one prefers white diamonds. AFAICT, their superintelligent versions both make diamonds.
2. Consider an AI aligned to evaluations of diamonds, versus the person who prefers white diamonds. AFAICT, the AI's superintelligent version will _not_ make diamonds, while the person will.

Why? There's "goal divergence from 'true diamond-motivation'" in both cases, no? "The proxies are closer in case 1" is a _lossy answer._ Better to ask "why do I believe what I believe? What, step-by-step, happens in case 1, compared to case 2? What mechanisms secretly generate my anticipations for these situations?"

<hr/>

Grader optimization is also bad because it violates the non-adversarial principle:

In the intended motivational structure, the actor tries to trick the grader, and the grader tries to avoid being tricked. I think we can realize massive alignment benefits by not designing motivational architectures which require extreme robustness properties and whose parts work at internal cross-purposes.

> Argmax violates the non-adversarial principle and wastes computation. Argmax requires you to spend effort hardening your own utility function against the effort you're _also expending_ searching across all possible inputs to your utility function (including the adversarial inputs!). For example, if I argmaxed over my own plan-evaluations, I'd have to consider the most terrifying-to-me [basilisks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk) possible, and _rate **none of them** unusually highly_. I'd have to spend effort hardening my own ability to evaluate plans, in order to safely consider those possibilities.

>
> For example, some infohazardous thoughts exist (like hyper-optimized-against-you basilisks) which are dangerous to think about (although most thoughts are probably safe). But an agent which plans its next increment of planning using a reflective self-model is IMO not going to be like "hey it would be predicted-great if I spent the next increment of time thinking about an entity which is trying to manipulate me." So e.g. a reflective agent trying to actually win with the available resources, wouldn't do something dumb like "run argmax" or "find the plan which some part of me evaluates _most highly._"

**Strong violation of the non-adversarial principle suggests that grader-optimization and argmax-over-all-plans are deeply and fundamentally unwise.**

<hr/>

This isn't to say that argmax’ing over all plans _can't_ be safe, even in theory. There _exist_ robust Platonic grader functions which assign highest expected utility to a non-bogus plan which we actually want. There might exist utility functions which are safe for AIXI to argmax.[^2]

**We** **are not going to find those globally safe Platonic functions. We should not try to find them. It doesn't make sense to align an agent that way. Committing to this design pattern means committing to evaluate every possible plan the AI might come up with. In my opinion, that's a crazy commitment.**

It's like saying, "What if I made a superintelligent sociopath who only cares about making toasters, and then arranged the world so that the only possible way they can make toasters is by making diamonds?". Yes, _possibly_ there do exist ways to arrange the world so as to satisfy this strange plan. But it's just deeply unwise to try to do! Don't make them care about making toasters, or about evaluations of how many diamonds they're making.

<hr/>

If we want an agent to produce diamonds, then I propose we make it care about producing diamonds. How?[^3] I have suggested [one simple baseline approach](/a-shot-at-the-diamond-alignment-problem) which I do not presently consider to be fundamentally blocked.

I suspect that, between me and other readers, what differs is more our models of intelligence. _Perhaps_ some people have reactions like:

> Sure, we know alignment is hard, it's hard to motivate agents without messing up their motivations. Old news. And yet you seem to think that _that's_ an "artifact" of grader-optimization? What _else_ could a smart agent be doing, if not optimizing some expected-utility function over all possible plans?

On my end, I have partial but detailed working models of how intelligence works and how values work, such that I can imagine cognition which is planning-based, agentic, and also **not** based on grader-optimization or global argmax over all plans. You'll read a detailed story in the next subsection.

# Grader optimization != planning

## And people aren't grader-optimizers, either

Imagine someone who considers a few plans, grades them (e.g. "how good does my gut say this plan is?"), and chooses the best. They are not a grader-optimizer. They are not _trying_ to navigate to the state where they propose and execute a plan which gets _maximally highly rated_ by some evaluative submodule. They _use_ a grading procedure to locally rate and execute plans, and may even _locally_ think "what would make me feel better about this plan?", but the _point_ of their optimization isn't "find the plan which makes me feel as good as globally possible."

Let's dive into concrete detail. Here's a [story](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dqSwccGTWyBgxrR58/turntrout-s-shortform-feed?commentId=X9ALHxk8J6rwEYnLM) of how value-child might think:

As a corollary, grader-optimization is not synonymous with planning. Grader-optimization is when high plan-evaluations are the _motivating cause_ of planning, where "I found a plan which I think leads to diamond" is the _terminal goal_, and not just a _side effect_ of cognition (as it is for values-child).

# Intended takeaways

[I am not in fact _perfectly_ pessimistic about grader-optimization](/dont-design-agents-which-exploit-adversarial-inputs#user-content-fn-6):

That said, I think this pattern is extremely unwise, and [alternative patterns AFAICT cleanly avoid incentivizing the agent to exploit adversarial inputs to the grader](/dont-design-agents-which-exploit-adversarial-inputs#user-content-fn-3). Thus, I bid that we:

However, if the action space is rich and expressive enough to include e.g. 3-paragraph English descriptions, I think that there will be seriously adversarial actions which will be found and exploited by smart approval-directed agents. - Given a small action space (e.g. $|\mathcal{A}|=10$), the adversarial input issue should be pretty tame (which is strictly separate from other issues with this approach).

# Conclusion

I strongly hope that this essay clarifies my thoughts around grader-optimization and its attendant unwisdom. The design patterns of "care about evaluations of plans" and "optimize a utility function over all possible futures" seem unnatural and lead to [enormous, apparently avoidable difficulties](/dont-design-agents-which-exploit-adversarial-inputs#The-parable-of-evaluation-child). I think there are enormous benefits to be reaped by considering a wider, [more realistic](/humans-provide-alignment-evidence) range of possible minds.

While this essay detailed how value-child might think, I haven't yet focused on why I think value-child does better, or what the general principles may be. I'll speculate on that in the next essay.

I.e. value-child's world-model overestimates the degree to which he can be made more-hardworking and avoid dying by having his friend poke around with sharp objects at his brain. So in using the world-model to search for a plan, he decides to ask his friend to poke around with sharp objects in his brain

It's not that I think e.g. shard-agents can freely avoid serious upwards errors, it's that they aren't _seeking them out on purpose_. As I wrote to Daniel K [in a recent comment](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/k4AQqboXz8iE5TNXK/a-shot-at-the-diamond-alignment-problem?commentId=3BFBhgQeHzBvJmjzi):

The point isn't that people can't or don't fall victim to plans which, by virtue of spurious appeal to a person's value shards, cause the person to unwisely pursue the plan. The point here is that (I claim) intelligent people convergently want to avoid this happening to them.
> >

Furthermore, I think that, in systems with multiple optimizers (e.g. shards), some optimizers can feed the _other optimizers_ adversarial inputs. (Adversarial inputs are most common in the presence of an adversary, after all!)

A rough guess at what this looks like: [A luxury-good-shard proposes a golden-laptop buying plan](https://www.readthesequences.com/Fake-Justification), while emphasizing how this purchase stimulates the economy and so helps people. This plan was optimized to positively activate e.g. the altruism-shard, so as to increase the plan's execution probability. In humans, I think this is more commonly known as _motivated reasoning_.

So, even in value-child, adversarial inputs can still crop up, but via a different mechanism. I think this mechanism should disappear once the agent gets smart enough to e.g. [do an internal values handshake](/a-shot-at-the-diamond-alignment-problem#The-values-handshake). As I [said](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jFCK9JRLwkoJX4aJA/don-t-design-agents-which-exploit-adversarial-inputs?commentId=exS9tLiWt5feXMnvz) to Wei Dai:

Namely, if you're trying to align e.g. a brute-force-search plan maximizer or a grader-optimizer, you will fail due to high-strength optimizer's curse forcing you to evaluate extremely scary adversarial inputs. But also this is sideways of real-world alignment, where [realistic motivations may not be best specified in the form of "utility function over observation/universe histories."](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dqSwccGTWyBgxrR58/turntrout-s-shortform-feed?commentId=xwJfX45CvaKXFFtCS)

As discussed in Daniel Dewey's [Learning What to Value](https://intelligence.org/files/LearningValue.pdf) and other places, if you try to implement this by putting the utility calculation in a box which rewards an AIXI-like RL agent, the agent can eventually learn to modify or remove the box, and happily does so if it can get more reward by doing so. This is because the RL agent predicts, and attempts to maximize, reward received. If it understands that it can modify the reward-giving box to get more reward, it will.

> We can fix this problem by integrating the same reward box with the agent in a better way. Rather than having the RL agent learn what the output of the box will be and plan to maximize the output of the box, we use the box _directly_ to evaluate possible futures, and have the agent plan to maximize that evaluation. Now, if the agent considers modifying the box, it evaluates that future _with the current box_. The box as currently configured sees no advantage to such tampering. This is called an observation-utility maximizer (to contrast it with reinforcement learning). Daniel Dewey goes on to show that we can incorporate uncertainty about the utility function into observation-utility maximizers, recovering the kind of "learning what is being rewarded" that RL agents were supposed to provide\[...\]

The point of this post isn't _just_ that e.g. value-child evaluates the future with his own values, as opposed to putting the utility calculation in a box. I'm not describing a failure of tampering with the grader. I'm describing a failure of _optimizing the output of a box / grader_, even if the box is _directly evaluating possible futures._ After all, evaluation-child uses the box to directly evaluate possible futures! Evaluation-child wants to maximize the evaluation of his model of his mother!

As described above, value-child is steered by his values. He isn't optimizing for the output of some module in his brain.

# Appendix C: Grader-optimization quiz

Grader optimization is about how the agent _thinks,_ it's about the way in which they are motivated\.

Promising, but spend a few more seconds generating ideas to avoid automatic opportunity cost from prematurely committing to the first idea. \[After all, doing otherwise historically led to fewer diamonds, which produced less [cognition-update-quantity (i.e. "reward")](/reward-is-not-the-optimization-target) than expected, and so his credit assignment chipped away at the impulse to premature action in this kind of situation.\]

>
> > ! No! Bill's cognition is shaped towards _acquiring diamonds_, his cognition reliably pulls him into futures where he has more diamonds. **This is not grader-optimization.** This is Bill caring about diamonds, not about his own evaluations of whether a plan will acquire diamonds.

## Scenario 2

> [!question] Is Bill a grader-optimizer?
>
> > ! Yes! Bill's optimizing for [either his future physical evaluation of plan quality, or some Platonic formalization of "Did I come up with a plan I think is promising?"](/four-usages-of-loss-in-ai#4-Agents-which-want-to-minimize-loss). Which? The story is ambiguous. But the mark of grader-optimization is quite plain, as given by a plan-generator stretching its wits to maximize the output of a grader.

[^1]: The actor may give an _instrumental_ damn about diamonds, because diamond-producing plans sometimes produce high evaluations. But in actor / grader motivational setups, an inner-aligned actor only gives a _terminal_ damn about the _evaluations_.
[^2]: Although AIXI's epistemic prior is [malign](https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/what-does-the-universal-prior-actually-look-like/) and possibly unsafe...
[^3]:
    You don't have to have another approach in mind in order to abandon grader-optimization. Here are some things I would ask myself, were I confused about how non-grader-optimizing agents might be motivated:

    \- "Hey, I realize some strangeness about this thing (grader-optimization) which I was trying to do. I wonder whether there are other perspectives or frame-shifts which would make this problem go away?"

    \- "I notice that I don't expect a paperclip-AI to resort to grader-optimization in order to implement its own unaligned values. [What do I anticipate would happen, internally, to an AI as I trained it via some RL curriculum](/a-shot-at-the-diamond-alignment-problem)? If it cared about paperclips, how would that caring be implemented, mechanistically?"

    \- "Hm, this way of caring about things seems weird. [In what ways is grader-optimization similar and dissimilar](/humans-provide-alignment-evidence) to the suspected ways in which [human beings care about things](/shard-theory)?"

[^4]: Contrast with a quote from the original article:

    > Similarly, if \[the actor\] is smarter than \[the grader\] expects, the only problem is that \[the actor\] won’t be able to use all of his intelligence to devise excellent plans. This is a serious problem, but it can be fixed by experimentation—rather than leading to surprising failure modes.

[^5]: Not that I think this has a snowflake's chance in hell of working in time. But it seemed important to show that not all indirect normativity is grader-optimization.
[^6]: Earlier this year, I [analyzed](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dqSwccGTWyBgxrR58/turntrout-s-shortform-feed?commentId=HFdJShX4F7Hztfxrw) how brute-force plan search might exploit this scheme for using an ELK direct translator.
