# FAQ

Why the name "TurnTrout"?
: Once upon a time, I was unpacking my [viola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola) when some dude walked by and said "HEY TURNTROUT!". Then he never said it again, no one talked about it again, everyone forgot about it. At least - everyone forgot until I wanted a Reddit username. And thus I chose `TurnTrout`.
: Over the years, more people came to know me for the research which I posted as `TurnTrout`. Now, people often recognize me by that name. Some people just say "hey 'Trout"!
