> [!quote] [Steering GPT-2-XL by adding an activation vector](/gpt2-steering-vectors)  
> \[We define\] **activation engineering** \[to be\] techniques which steer models by modifying their activations. As a complement to prompt engineering and finetuning, activation engineering is a low-overhead way to steer models at runtime.

These results were recently complemented by [Inference-Time Intervention: Eliciting Truthful Answers from a Language Model](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kuQfnotjkQA4Kkfou/inference-time-intervention-eliciting-truthful-answers-from), which doubled TruthfulQA performance by adding a similarly computed activation vector to forward passes!

We think that activation engineering offers easy wins for steering and understanding models. A few open problems from [the list](https://coda.io/@alice-rigg/open-problems-in-activation-engineering):

- Try decomposing the residual stream activations over a batch of inputs somehow (e.g. PCA). Using the principal directions as activation addition directions, do they seem to capture something meaningful?
- Take a circuit studied from existing literature on GPT2, or find another one using [ACDC](https://github.com/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery/tree/main). Targeting the nodes in these circuits, can you learn anything more about them and generally about how activation additions interact with circuits?
- What's the mechanism by which adding a steering vector with too large a coefficient breaks the model?
