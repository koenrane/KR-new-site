# Quotations

> Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.
>
> -- Orwell, _1984_

<hr/>

> A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus:
>
> 1. What am I trying to say?
> 2. What words will express it?
> 3. What image or idiom will make it clearer?
> 4. Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?
>
> And he will probably ask himself two more:
>
> 1. Could I put it more shortly?
> 2. Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?
>
> But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in.
>
> -- Orwell's [_Politics and the English Language_](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/)

# $\KaTeX$ math mode

Math coloring is automatically translated to accord with site styling: ${\color{red}x}={\color{blue}y}$. I mean, seriously, who wants to read text that looks like <em><span style="color:#ff0000;">this</span></em>? 🤡

# Spoilers

I couldn't find a `rehype` or `remark` plugin I liked, so I produced my own. This spoiler is unobtrusive and fits in with the broad site aesthetic.

The following spoiler box is larger:

# Smart quotes

I wrote a [`rehype`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype) plugin which scans my website and adjusts quote marks so that they are properly oriented. The plugin also moves around punctuation so that periods are generally inside of quotations while webpage commas are generally outside. For example:

- I said "hi there," but he couldn't hear me.
- "Why don't you just tell him 'I love you'?"
- ("Don't do it," they said...)
- "'There's a good boy' is what I tell my dog when he behaves."
- "I never again want to hear 'I lost the game'."
- I love Bryan Adam's [_Summer of '69_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFjjO_lhf9c)[^69]
  [^69]: Seriously, this song is a banger.

In fact, all of the bullet points were written so that the rules were violated. This page should still render them properly. However, this functionality should not apply within code blocks:

- `results['column']`
- `'` and `"hi"` and `'hi'`
- `print('honk!')`
- `print("honk!")`
# Markdown captions for tables and figures

The [`remark-captions`](https://npmjs.com/package/remark-captions) package makes it easy to add captions. 

![[https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/goose-majestic.avif|Sample image of a majestic goose.]]
Figure: The most _majestic_ animal known to humanity.


| Left  | Right |
| :---: | :---: |
| Lower | text  |

Table: This is a table caption. *Emphasis* and **bolding** are preserved.

```typescript 
/**
 * Replaces number-preceding hyphens with minus signs (−).
 *
 * @param {string} text
 * @returns {string} The modified string
 */
const minusReplace = (text: string): string => {
  const numberMatch = /(^|\s)\-(\s?\d*\.?\d+)/g
  return text.replace(numberMatch, "$1−$2")
}
```
Code: Part of [my website processing pipeline](https://github.com/alexander-turner/TurnTrout.com/blob/main/quartz/plugins/transformers/minus_sign.ts).
# Smart dash conversion

[Merriam-Webster ordains that](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/em-dash-en-dash-how-to-use) - contrary to popular practice - hyphens (-) and em-dashes (—) be used in importantly different situations:

> [!quote] [How to Use Em Dashes (—), En Dashes (–) , and Hyphens (-)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/em-dash-en-dash-how-to-use)
> The em dash (—) can function like a comma, a colon, or parenthesis. Like commas and parentheses, em dashes set off extra information, such as examples, explanatory or descriptive phrases, or supplemental facts. Like a colon, an em dash introduces a clause that explains or expands upon something that precedes it.

My `formatting_improvement_html.ts` contains `hyphenReplace`, which prevents clauses from being delimited by hyphens ("`I - like you - object`"). Instead, the build process renders "I - like you - object."

# Smallcaps

The build process detects acronyms ("HTML") and abbreviations ("100GB") and then tags them with the `small-caps` class. The CSS then styles the tagged elements in smallcaps. There are a lot of acronyms on my site, so it's very nice to not have to tag them manually![^smallcaps]

## Font adjustments

The site's font family is [EB Garamond](http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond). However, as of April 2024, the font did not support slashed zeroes (the `zero` feature). The unslashed zeroes looked quite similar to the letter 'o.' Furthermore, the italicized font did not support the `cv11` OpenType feature for oldstyle numerals (such as '2', which only reach up to the x-height of lowercase letters). This meant that the italicized oldstyle '1' looked like a small uppercase 'I', which wasn't very pleasant to my eyes.

Therefore, I paid [Hisham Karim](https://www.fiverr.com/hishamhkarim) $121 to add these features. I have notified the maintainer of the EB Garamond font. 😌

## Automatic fraction display

> 99 1/2% of websites don't render fractions properly.
> -- Albert Einstein

I chose slanted fractions in order to slightly increase the height of the numerals in the numerator and denominator. People are 2/3 water, but "01/01/2000" should not be rendered as a fraction.

- Multiplication sign conversion makes multipliers exactly 2x as pleasant to read. See also: 5/4x.
- Full-width slashes are used for separators like "cat" / "dog."

> A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible.

> > What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way about. In prose, the worst thing one can do with words is to surrender to them. When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then, if you want to describe the thing you have been visualising, you probably hunt about till you find the exact words that seem to fit it. When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning.

> > Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and get one's meanings as clear as one can through pictures and sensations. Afterward one can choose – not simply *accept* – the phrases that will best cover the meaning, and then switch round and decide what impression one's words are likely to make on another person. This last effort of the mind cuts out all stale or mixed images, all prefabricated phrases, needless repetitions, and humbug and vagueness generally.

# Twemoji

I prefer the flat style of Twitter emoji. This also unifies UX across devices, as emoji are not rendered in a browser- or OS-specific fashion.
