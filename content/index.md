Hello! I’m TurnTrout, and this is my pond. Stay a while! _The Pond_ gathers my writings on topics including AI, self-improvement, and living a good life.

The earliest content dates back to January 2018. Over the years, I've built up a web of ideas and philosophies. I even endorse some of them still! I love [[My research]], and I hope you love it too.

I also enjoy writing more personal content and sharing a bit [[about me]]. While my blog's [previous home ](http://www.lesswrong.com/user/turntrout) made "TurnTrout" a familiar name to some folks, only a narrow part of me got to shine through.
