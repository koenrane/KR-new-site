There was a long-lasting man-made sound outside my home last night. I couldn't come up with a good explanation for what the sound was or why it was outside my house. My brain naturally promoted the hypothesis that a psychopathic murderer was outside my house making the strange noises. I noticed this was absurd, and predicted that, in the morning, I would find this explanation much less concerning. Sure enough, when I woke up, I thought the whole thing was rather goofy.

Now, supposing there had been a psychopathic murderer outside my house, it wasn't like I was at much more risk at night, since I was planning on staying indoors. This seems like a pretty clear manifestation of [nychtophobia](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/37725610/Nyctophobia_article.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DNyctophobia_From_imagined_to_realistic_f.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20191222%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20191222T201333Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=78100b25f213dab9e788488847a10e642cd75b1fd5d2a8e05baabac6cd8c6055): fear of the dark magnifying our fears of being attacked or victimized.

My question is: does this apply more generally? Might we be more risk-averse at night, or otherwise biased?[^1] Suppose I plan to soon leave work and walk home along a dimly lit path. Then suppose I make an unrelated decision - am I more likely to be conservative or fearful in weighing that decision, above and beyond the normal effects of having recently considered something slightly distressing?

[^1]: [One study indicated](https://psychcentral.com/news/2014/04/02/night-owls-are-risk-takers/67976.html) that night owls are actually risk-takers, but there's a lot of confounders there with respect to nychtophobia-related explanations.
